# What is Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA)? 

## What is MFA?

- Popular factorial method to study sets of variables that are collected on the same set of observations
- Generalization of principal component analysis (PCA)
- Provides factor loadings to indicate the impact of variables on components
- Factor scores (component scores in PCA) are returned to explain the effect of each observation on the factors
- Analysis provides a means of quantifying a level of agreement or disagreement between sets of variables

# Methodology
## Input Data
* Sets (or tables) of the same observations across different variables can be represented as:  
$$ Y = [Y_1, \ldots, Y_k] $$
* $k$ represents the number of sets to be included in the analysis  

* Each set contains _any_ number of variables


$$\{Y_1, \ldots, Y_k\} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m_i}\; \text{for}\; i = 1, \ldots k$$


* Sets can share or have their own unique variables 
    - the number of observations (rows) for each set needs to remain be the same

## Pre-processing

- Pre-processing of the $k$ tables can be completed by mean-centering and/or scaling each of the columns. We will represent the processed tables of $Y$ as: 

$$ X = [X_1, \ldots, X_k] $$

- $X_k$ is the centered and/or scaled representation of $Y_k$. 

- The concatenation of all centered and/or scaled tables is defined as $X$.

## Singular Value Decomposition

- We can decompose each set by using singular value decomposition (SVD): 
$$X_{[k]} = U_{[k]} \Gamma_{[k]} V_{[k]}^T$$
where,
$$
\begin{aligned}
X_{[k]} &\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m} \;\; &U_{[k]} &\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m} \\
\Gamma_{[k]} &\in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m} \; \; &V_{[k]} &\in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m} \\
U_{[k]}^T U_{[k]} &= I_{m \times m} \;\; & V_{[k]}^TV_{[k]} &= I_{m \times m}
\end{aligned}
$$
- Using the left singular vectors $U_{[k]}$, we can calculate a __factor score__ for each table: 
$$ G_{[k]} = U_{[k]} \Gamma_{[k]} $$


## Calculate $\alpha$

- Using the first singular value from each table $\gamma_{1,k}$ we can define $\alpha$ as: 
$$ \alpha_k = \frac{1}{\gamma_{1,k}^2} = \frac{1}{\lambda_{1,k}}$$ 

- $\lambda_{1,k}$ is the eigenvalue for the first singular value $\gamma_{1,k}$ 

- Each set has a weight, $\alpha_k$ which can be collected into a single vector $a$: 
$$ a = [\alpha_1 1_{[1]}, \ldots,  \alpha_k 1_{[k]}]$$ 
$a$ is a numVar-by-1` vector, where numVar is the number of variables in the analysis.  $\mathbb{1}_{[k]}$ is a vector of ones with a length equal to the number of variables of the $k$th table.

## Generalized Singular Value Decomposition

- We can decompose the concatenated matrix $X$ by using generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) as follows: 
$$ X = P \Delta Q^T $$
where, 
$$ X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m},\;\; P,\Delta \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n},\;\; Q^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$$

## Generalized Singular Value Decomposition

- GSVD adds additional constraints in the form of:
$$ P M P^T = I, \;\; Q^T A Q = I$$

- $M = \text{diag}(m)$,  $M \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$
    + $M$ is a mass matrix with $m_i$ assigned to each of the $i$ observations
    + For equal weighting across the observations, $m_i =\frac{1}{I}$ where $I$ is the number of observations
    
- $A = \text{diag}(a)$,  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$
    + weight matrix of $\alpha$ values (derived earlier) 

## Generalized Singular Value Decomposition 

To calculate $P$ and $Q$ we will need to define $\tilde{X}$:
$$ \tilde{X} = M^{1/2} X A^{1/2} \Longleftrightarrow X = M^{-1/2} \tilde{X} A^{-1/2}$$

Decomposing $\tilde{X}$ with SVD:
$$ \tilde{X} = U D V^T $$

The generalized eigenvector matrices for GSVD can be obtained by: 
$$ P = M^{-1/2} U  \;\;\;\; Q = A^{-1/2} V^T \;\;\;\; \Delta = D $$

## Factor Scores

- Utilizing the matrix decomposed by GSVD we can calculate the __factor scores__ by:
$$ F = P \Delta $$ 
where $P$ and $\Delta$ are from the GSVD decomposition. Each row of the factor score matrix represents an observation and each column is a component. 

- Projection of the $k$th table onto the compromise, is also known as the __partial factor scores__. Partial factor scores can be computed as:

$$ F_{[k]} = K \alpha_k X_{[k]} Q_{[k]}$$
where $K$ is the number total number of tables in the analysis, $\alpha_k = \gamma_{1,k}^{-2}$, $X_{[k]}$ is the $k$th table and $Q_{[k]}$ is the $k$th portion of the right eigenvector matrix.

# Demo
## Wine Tasting Dataset
- A set of wines were evaluated by a group of assessors

- Each assessors was asked to evaluate the wine on a 9-point scale using four variables (cat-pee, passion fruit, green pepper, and mineral)
    + An assessor could also include additional variables if they felt the need 

- Rows in this data set will indicate the the different types of wines that were evaluated, the observations

- Columns will represent the different variables of taste

- Each set (table) will be one assessors evaluation of the wines with their respective tasting variables

## Loading the data

- The function `loadWineData()` is used to load csv file into a data.frame. 
```
data <- loadWineData()
```
- A data.frame or table can be used as input to the MFA package

- Sets is used to partition the input data into sets (tables) by assessor. In this example we have 10 assessors indexed by their column number. 
```
sets <- list(  seq(2,7), seq(8,13), seq(14,19), seq(20,24),
           seq(25,30), seq(31,35), seq(36,39), seq(40,45),
           seq(46,50), seq(51,54) )
```
- Sets can either be a list of variable names or the column index. 

## Creating an MFA Object 

- To perform multiple factor analysis on the sets of data:
```
dsWine <- mfa(data, sets)
```
- `dsWine` is a __mfa__ object which has completed the mulitple factor analysis

- The command above is actually executing:
```
dsWine <- mfa(data, sets, ncomps = NULL, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
```

- where the following optional inputs are: 
    + __ncomps__: the number of components returned in the analysis
    + __center__: centering of each of the sets utilizing the R base function `scale()` 
    + __scale__: scales each of the sets by utilizing the R base function `scale()`

```


## Factor Scores {.smaller}

- Factor scores can provide insight on which combination of factors underlie the observed data 

- Factor scores are a property of the  __mfa__ object. Looking at the first two components:

```
dsWine$factorScores[,1:2]

        [,1]   [,2]
 [1,] -0.980  0.163
 [2,] -0.809  0.033
 [3,] -0.761 -0.454
 [4,] -1.115 -0.166
 [5,]  1.373 -0.128
 [6,]  1.264 -0.108
 [7,]  0.808  0.205
 [8,]  0.925  0.408
 [9,] -0.669  0.369
 [10,]  0.073 -0.757
 [11,] -0.476  0.513
 [12,]  0.367 -0.076
```


## Partial factor scores and loadings 

- Partial factor scores and loading matrices are stored in the __mfa__ object. 
    + There are $N$ number of partial factor score matrices, where N is the number of sets (tables) in the analysis. The following code will return the partial factor score for the first table.

```
dsWine$partialFactorScores[1]
```

- Matrix loadings are the right singular vectors of the generalized singular value decomposition ($Q$). Loadings can be obtained by:  

```
dsWine$matrixLoadings
```

## Calculating R$_v$ and L$_g$ coeffient 

- The function ``rv(table1, table2)`` will calculate the R$_v$ coefficient: 
$$ R_{v_{k,\prime{k}}} = \frac{\text{trace} \left\{ \left(X_{[k]}X_{[k]}^T  \right) \times \left(  X_{[k^\prime]}X_{[k^\prime]}^T \right) \right\} } { \sqrt{\text{trace} \left\{ \left(X_{[k]}X_{[k]}^T  \right) \times  \left(X_{[k]}X_{[k]}^T  \right)  \right\}  \\ \times \text{trace} \left\{ \left(  X_{[k^\prime]}X_{[k^\prime]}^T \right) \times \left(  X_{[k^\prime]}X_{[k^\prime]}^T \right)   \right\} }  }  $$ 

- Similarly ``lg(table1, table2)`` is used to calculate the L$_g$ coefficient: 

$$L_{g(k,k^\prime)} = \frac{ \text{trace} \left\{ \left( X_{[k]} X_{[k]}^T \right)  \times \left( X_{[k^\prime]} X_{[k^\prime]}^T \right)   \right\}   }{ \gamma_{1,k}^2 \times \gamma_{1,k^\prime}^2}$$

## Bootstrap Factor Scores

- By sampling with replacement (bootstrap) we are able to get estimates of the variance of our factor scores. This function is available by using `bootstrap_factorscores(obj)` on a __mfa__ object. This function returns the bootstrap estimate of the factor score:

$$ \overline{F}^* = \frac{1}{L} \sum_\ell^L F_{\ell}^* $$ 

- Bootstrap estimate of the variance: 

$$ \hat{\sigma_{F^*}}^2 = \frac{1}{L} \left( \sum_\ell^L \left( F_\ell^* - \overline{F}^* \right) \circ \left( F_\ell^* - \overline{F}^* \right)  \right)$$

- Bootstrap ratios (Student's t statistic):  $T^* = \overline{F}^* / \hat{\sigma_{F^*}}$ 

# Shiny App

## Run Application

For the wine dataset labels are used for visualization:

```
mfa_obj <- dsWine
active_var_names <- loadWineInfo()$varkeys
active_obs_names <- loadWineInfo()$obskeys
active_col_vec <- loadWineInfo()$colors
MFA::runExample()
```
